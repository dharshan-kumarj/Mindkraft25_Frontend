Players must search the outer perimeter of the classroom for three flags. Two flags are hidden somewhere within the environment. The third flag is earned, not found. Players must compete in a quick game of XOX (Tic-Tac-Toe) against a game master. The winner of the XOX game receives the third flag. Once a player has successfully located the two hidden flags and won the XOX game to acquire the third flag, they have completed Level 1. Only then are they allowed to proceed to Level 2. This ensures that players can't just rush through to the final level without demonstrating some skill and thoroughness. The Inner layer: This is the final and more difficult level. Players now enter the inner part of the classroom. Here, five more flags are hidden. These flags might be more cleverly concealed than the ones in Level 1. Winning the Game: The player who finds all eight flags (three from Level 1 and five from Level 2) in the fastest time wins the game. A timer is likely used to track each player's progress.",
